So you're looking to get that [Spark Developer Associate](https://www.databricks.com/learn/certification/apache-spark-developer-associate) badge? As part of my own preparation for the exam, I've written a short description for each of the (high-level) topics that are mentioned at the end of the Databricks course, so you don't have to. ðŸ˜‰

The exam consists of 60 questions, and covers three main topics:
- Spark Architecture Concepts (17%)
- Spark Architecture Applications (11%)
- Spark DataFrame API Applications (72%)

Covering 72% of all questions, **the DataFrame API is the most important**. Unfortunately, this is also the section that will require the most hand-on experience. So unless you're like that one lawyer in the series Suits (Michael Ross), and you can memorize the entire documentation word for word, you'll need to **get your hands dirty**. Just a fair warning.

_There's a lot of material to cover, so let's get going!_

# Spark Architecture Concepts (17%)

## Clusters

### Nodes

- Driver nodes: The driver node is the entry point for a Spark application. It runs the `main` function and creates the `SparkContext`, coordinating the distribution of tasks across worker nodes.
- Worker nodes: Worker nodes are responsible for executing tasks assigned by the driver. They store data and perform computations.

### Executors

- Relationship with worker nodes: Executors are processes launched on worker nodes to run Spark tasks. Each worker node can have multiple executors.
- Relationship with the JVM: Each executor runs within a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), isolating tasks and providing fault tolerance.

### Slots

- Description: A slot is a basic unit of parallelism in Spark. It represents the computational capacity of an executor to execute a single task.
- Purpose: Slots allow multiple tasks to run concurrently on a single executor, maximizing parallelism and resource utilization.

## Execution Hierarchy

### Application

- Description of a Spark application: A Spark application is a self-contained computation, consisting of a driver program and a set of parallelized tasks executed on a cluster.

### Jobs

- Description of Spark Jobs: A job is a Spark application's high-level unit of work. It consists of stages, and it is initiated by an action triggered in the driver program.

### Stages

- Description of Spark stages: A stage is a set of tasks that can be executed in parallel without data shuffling. Stages are determined by transformations that have narrow dependencies.
- Identify what separates a Job into multiple stages: A job is divided into stages at the boundaries where data needs to be shuffled between partitions.

### Tasks

- Description of Spark Tasks: A task is the smallest unit of work in Spark, representing the execution of a single operation on a partition of data.

## Distribution

### Shuffles

- Description of shuffling: Shuffling is the process of redistributing data across the partitions, often involving data exchange between nodes. It can be a costly operation.
- Operations that result in a shuffle: Operations like `groupByKey`, `reduceByKey`, and `join` result in shuffling.
- Configuration prone to a lot of shuffling: Setting a high level of parallelism or having a small number of partitions can lead to increased shuffling.

### Partitions

- Description of partitions: Partitions are basic units of data parallelism in Spark. Each partition holds a subset of the data, and tasks operate on partitions independently.
- Configurations that affect partitioning: The number of partitions is affected by configurations like `spark.default.parallelism` and can be controlled during operations like `repartition`.

## Execution Patterns

### Lazy Evaluation

- Description of Lazy Evaluation: Lazy evaluation is a strategy where transformations on RDDs are not immediately executed. Instead, they are recorded, and the execution is deferred until an action is called.
- Advantages: It minimizes unnecessary computations, optimizes execution plans, and improves performance.
- Operations that trigger evaluation: Actions like `count`, `collect`, and `saveAsTextFile` trigger the evaluation of transformations.

### Transformations

- Description of transformations: Transformations are operations that create a new RDD from an existing one. They are lazily evaluated.
- Narrow vs. wide transformations: Narrow transformations (_e.g._, `map`) do _not_ require data shuffling, while wide transformations (_e.g._, `groupByKey`) _do_ involve shuffling.

### Actions

- Description of actions: Actions are operations that trigger the execution of transformations and return a result to the driver program or write data to an external storage system.
- Operations that are actions: Examples include `count`, `collect`, `saveAsTextFile`, and `reduce`.

## Clusters

### Execution and Deployment Modes

- Purpose of driver and executor setup: The driver program is responsible for coordinating the Spark application, while executors are responsible for task execution. The setup ensures the distribution and parallel processing of tasks.
- Types of deployment modes:Cluster mode: Driver and executors run on the cluster.Client mode: Driver runs on the client machine, connecting to executors on the cluster.Local mode: Both driver and executors run on the local machine for development and testing.

### Fault Tolerance and Stability

- Reasons a Spark application will fail: Network issues, hardware failures, and application bugs can lead to failures.
- Fault-tolerant cluster setups: Spark provides fault tolerance through lineage information and recomputing lost data. Configurations like replication factor and checkpointing enhance fault tolerance.

## Storage

### Caching

- How Spark caches data: Spark caches data in memory, reducing recomputation by storing computed results.
- When to cache DataFrames: Cache DataFrames when they are reused, reducing computation time.

### Storage Levels

- Types of storage level: a link to the [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#rdd-persistence) would be easiest ðŸ˜‰
- Default storage level: `MEMORY_ONLY`
When to use each storage level: Choose based on memory constraints and computation needs.

### Out-of-memory Errors

- Why out-of-memory errors occur: Large datasets or inefficient transformations can exceed available memory.
- Strategies for reducing out-of-memory errors: Increase cluster size, optimize code, or use storage levels to spill to disk.

### Garbage Collection

- Purpose: To reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use.
- Efficient garbage collection configurations: Configure garbage collection settings based on memory requirements, considering options like G1GC.

## Partitioning

### Repartitioning

- How to repartition a `DataFrame`: Use the `repartition` method to increase or decrease the number of partitions.

### Coalescing

- How to coalesce a `DataFrame`: Use the `coalesce` method to reduce the number of partitions without shuffling.
- Relationship with repartitioning a `DataFrame`: Coalescing is a more efficient operation when reducing partitions, as it avoids full shuffling.

### Data Skew

- Describe data skew: Data skew occurs when certain partitions have significantly more data than others, leading to uneven processing.
- General strategies for avoiding data skew: Preprocess data to distribute keys evenly, use salting techniques, or leverage specific join strategies.

### AQE Skew Handling

- Configurations needed for automatic skew handling: Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) automatically handles skew. No specific configurations are required.

## Structures (`DataFrame`)

### Basics

- Description of Spark `DataFrames`: `DataFrames` are distributed collections of data organized into named columns, providing a higher-level abstraction than RDDs.
- Spark class used as the base for `DataFrames`: `org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame`

### Types and Execution

- Possible column types: many exist, see the [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-datatypes.html).
- Parallel execution: DataFrames support parallel execution, enabling distributed data processing.

## Broadcasting

### Variables

- How to broadcast a variable: Use the `broadcast` function to mark a variable for broadcasting.
- What it means to `broadcast` a variable: Broadcasting a variable means sharing it efficiently across all nodes to reduce data transfer overhead.

### Joins

- Configurations for automatic broadcast joins: Set `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold` to determine the size threshold for automatic broadcast joins.
- When broadcast joins are advantageous: Broadcast joins are beneficial when one side of the join is small enough to fit in memory.

### Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)

- Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) is an optimization technique in Spark SQL that makes use of the runtime statistics to choose the most efficient query execution plan.
- How to set up Spark to automatically handle broadcast joins using AQE: AQE automatically handles broadcast joins without specific setup, improving performance.
